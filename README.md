# eve-market-track

Problems this app might solve:

- Efficiently keeping track of a large number of orders
  - Knowing when to:
    - relist
    - buy/import more
    - leave alone

Optimized for moving lots of small orders for modest margins.

Doesn't deal with buy orders well yet.
Goonmetrics is still better for finding deals.
